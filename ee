"As an expert in application security, documentation, and process improvement, I am requesting an enhancement to the 'Application Security Work Instruction for Design Specifications' document. Please refine its content by integrating industry best practices, secure design principles, threat modeling techniques, compliance requirements (e.g., OWASP, NIST, ISO 27001), and risk mitigation strategies. Additionally, focus on improving the overall process efficiency, clarity, and effectiveness to ensure seamless adoption. The document should be structured professionally, providing clear, actionable guidance for secure software design while optimizing workflow and security integration."
